## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for executing assignment 3 Parallel computing. 

### Loading packages
The first step is installing and loading packages.
```{r, message = FALSE}
# Check for installed packages, when not present this code will install them.
packages <- c("rcdk", "iterators", "doParallel")
if (length(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages()))) > 0) {
  install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
}

# loading packages
# rcdk: this package allows users to access cheminformatics functionality of the CDK, a Java library
library(rcdk)
# iterators: this package includes several functions for creating iterators 
library(iterators)
# doParallel: this package provides a mechanism to execute foreach loops in parallel
library(doParallel)
```

### Importing the data
The Structure Data File (SDF) will be imported and used to calculate the descriptors. Due to large size of the file an iterator will be applied. For this step the 'rcdk' and 'iterators' packages will be used. The iterator adds the molecules to the mols list.  
```{r}
# the number of imported molecules
n <- 100

# using the iterator reader to go through the molecules one by one and add them to mols list
iter <- iload.molecules('C:/Users/daphn/OneDrive/Documenten/Master Systems Biology/Scientific programming/assignment3/3108202650709897102.sdf/3108202650709897102.sdf', type='sdf')
# Create a progress bar to display the progress of importing the molecules 
pb <- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = n, style = 3)
# set counter
counter <- 0
# create empty mols list
mols <- list()
while(hasNext(iter)) {
    # update counter  
    counter <- counter + 1
    # save selected molecule (nextElem returns the next value)
    mols[[counter]] = nextElem(iter)
    # print progress bar
    setTxtProgressBar(pb, counter)
    if(counter == n){ 
    break
    }
}
close(pb)
```

### Computing molecular descriptors in parallel
Next I will calculate the molecular descriptors of the selected molecules in parallel using the parallel functions and the doParallel package. In which I will only save the time it takes to calculate the descriptors. I also checked whether the calculations where the same for computing the descriptors in sequence. They turned out to be identical meaning that the calculation of the descriptors in parallel is thread safe. 
```{r}
# find maximum number of cores of the system
num.cores <- detectCores() - 1

# define the set of descriptors to be calculated
descNames <- unique(unlist(sapply(get.desc.categories()[2:4], get.desc.names)))
# initialise progress bar
pb <- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = num.cores, style = 3) 
# turn molecules into smiles (which is a compressed format of chemical structure)
smiles <- lapply(unlist(mols), get.smiles)

# create an empty list to store the results in
times <- list()
# in this for loop the descriptors will be calculated in parallel using different amount of cores
for(i in 1:num.cores){
  cl <- makeCluster(i)
  # this function exports the data to the core
  clusterExport(cl, "smiles")
  clusterExport(cl, "descNames")
  # because I use a particular package I need to load them through clusterEvalQ function. 
  clusterEvalQ(cl, library(rcdk))
  # for the next part I used the doParallel package 
  registerDoParallel(cl)
  times[i] <- system.time(foreach(x=1:n, .combine=rbind) %dopar% eval.desc(parse.smiles(smiles[[x]]),descNames))
  setTxtProgressBar(pb, i)
  stopCluster(cl)
}
``` 

### Results
Finally, I plot the results. 
```{r}
plot(unlist(times),xlab="number of cores",ylab="time (sec)",main=paste0("Time it took to compute descriptors for ",n," molecules"),type='b')
```
