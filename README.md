## Assignment 3 Parallel computing

Processing big data mostly requires lots of computing. Dividing a large problem into smaller problems and solving these smaller problems simultaneously can solve the computing issue. This type of computation is called parallel computing in which the execution of many processes are performed at the same time. In this assignment an algorithm will be designed to process the data in parallel. The data used for this assignment can be downloaded from PubChem (PubChem Assay AID 624202). 

An R Markdown notebook is created to carry out this assignment. The rcdk package will be used to calculate the molecular descriptors and making the code parallel. The research questions underlying this assignment consists of 1: When making use of 2 or 4 cores does this also make your code twice of four times faster? And 2: Which CDK descriptors are not thread-safe?

### How to run the code
